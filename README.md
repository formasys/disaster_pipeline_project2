# disaster_pipeline_project2
In this project we have developed a machine learning model which takes input messages during disaster and direct to a respective relief agency that can provide quick assistance.

This project is divided in the following parts:

- Processing data, building ETL pipeline to extract data from source, clean the data and save them in a SQLite DB. (data file)
- Build a machine learning pipeline which can classify text message in various categories. (model file)
- Run a web app which can take user input and show the classified model results in real time. (app file)
